- **Consumers:** Higher confidence in product authenticity
- **Market differentiation:** Unique feature in Russian market
- **Premium positioning:** Justifies higher pricing tier for brands

**Estimated Development:** 3-4 months (research + implementation + testing)

---

### 2. Offline-to-Online Retargeting with Ad Pixels

**Problem It Solves:**
Brands lose potential customers after QR scan - no way to re-engage users who showed interest by scanning but didn't complete a purchase or action. Current post-scan journey ends at destination URL.

**Solution:**
Integrate Meta Pixel and Google Ads retargeting (inspired by Beaconstac):
- Embed tracking pixels when QR codes are scanned
- Create custom audiences of QR scanners in Facebook/Instagram/Google
- Enable brands to retarget with ads showing 10x higher CTR

- UI for brands to connect their ad accounts
- Analytics dashboard showing retargeting performance

**Expected User Impact:**
- **Brands:** 15-25% increase in conversion rates from QR campaigns
- **ROI:** Track full customer journey from physical product to online purchase
- **Competitive advantage:** Bridge offline packaging with digital marketing
- **Revenue:** Premium feature for paid tiers

**Estimated Development:** 6-8 weeks

---

### 3. Geographic Heatmaps with Engagement Analytics

**Problem It Solves:**
Brands know total scans but not WHERE scans happen or HOW LONG users engage. Cannot optimize product placement, identify high-performing regions, or detect geographic counterfeiting patterns.

**Solution:**
Implement GPS-based heatmap analytics (inspired by QR Tiger):
- Capture GPS coordinates on scan (with user permission)
- Visualize scan density on interactive map with color coding
  - Red/orange = high engagement (longer time on post-scan page)
  - Blue/purple = low engagement
- Regional breakdown reports (by city, district, store location)
- Time-based heatmap animation (see geographic spread over time)

**Implementation Complexity:** **Medium**
- GPS coordinate capture (requires user permission prompt)

- Privacy compliance (anonymize coordinates to district-level for display)

**Expected User Impact:**
- **Brands:** Optimize product distribution based on scan patterns
- **Retail partners:** Prove product popularity in specific locations
- **Anti-counterfeit:** Detect geographic clusters of fake products
- **Marketing:** Target regional campaigns based on engagement

**Estimated Development:** 4-6 weeks

---

### 4. Dynamic QR Codes with Editable Destination URLs

**Problem It Solves:**
Printed QR codes on packaging are static - once printed, the destination cannot change. Brands cannot run campaigns, update information, or redirect codes without reprinting packaging.

**Solution:**
Implement dynamic QR code system (all competitors have this):
- QR code encodes a short redirect URL (e.g., chestno.ru/c/ABC123)
- Backend redirects to target URL stored in database
- Brands can change destination URL anytime via dashboard
- Track clicks and redirects separately from original QR scans
- Schedule URL changes (e.g., holiday campaign redirects)

**Implementation Complexity:** **Low**
- Create redirect service with short URL generation
- Add "destination URL" field to QR customization settings
- UI to edit destination URL post-creation
- Analytics to track redirects vs. direct scans

**Expected User Impact:**
- **Brands:** Huge cost savings - no reprinting for content updates
- **Campaign flexibility:** Run time-limited promotions on existing packaging
- **Product lifecycle:** Update product info/manuals after printing
- **Recall management:** Redirect to safety notices if needed

**Estimated Development:** 2-3 weeks

---

### 5. Device Type & Browser Analytics Dashboard

**Problem It Solves:**
Brands don't know if consumers scan with iOS, Android, or desktop devices. Cannot optimize post-scan experience for specific platforms or detect scanning patterns (e.g., in-store mobile vs. at-home desktop research).

**Solution:**
Track and display device/browser analytics (inspired by QR Tiger):
- Capture User-Agent on scan (server-side)
- Classify into: iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, Other
- Browser detection: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Yandex Browser
- Display in analytics dashboard:
  - Top 3 devices used
  - Platform breakdown (pie chart)
  - Time-series by device type
- Cross-reference with geographic data (e.g., Android dominant in certain regions)

**Implementation Complexity:** **Low**
- User-Agent parsing library (e.g., ua-parser-js)
- Database schema update: add `device_type`, `browser`, `os_version` to qr_events table
- Frontend analytics components (pie charts, breakdown tables)
- Mobile-optimized post-scan pages based on device stats

**Expected User Impact:**
- **Brands:** Optimize landing pages for top device types
- **UX improvement:** Detect if mobile users struggle with desktop-only pages
- **Market insights:** Understand customer demographics (iOS = premium segment)
- **Development priorities:** Focus efforts on dominant platforms

**Estimated Development:** 1-2 weeks

---

### 6. QR Code Expiry & Scheduled Activation

**Problem It Solves:**
Brands run time-limited campaigns but cannot enforce QR code validity periods. Promotional codes remain active forever, causing confusion or unintended redemptions. No way to pre-activate codes for future campaigns.

**Solution:**
Add expiry dates and scheduled activation (inspired by QR Tiger):
- **Expiry Date:** QR code stops working after specified date/time
  - Redirect to "Campaign ended" page with custom message
  - Analytics track "expired scan attempts" to measure continued interest
- **Scheduled Activation:** QR code activates at future date
  - Early scans show "Coming soon" page with countdown timer
  - Useful for product launches, pre-release campaigns
- **Bulk scheduling:** Set expiry/activation for multiple codes at once

**Implementation Complexity:** **Low**
- Add `active_from` and `active_until` fields to QR code table
- Middleware to check validity before redirecting
- Custom "expired" and "coming soon" landing pages
- UI controls (date pickers) in QR creation/editing form

**Expected User Impact:**
- **Brands:** Control campaign timing without manual code deactivation
- **Compliance:** Ensure promotional offers end on legal deadline
- **Product launches:** Build anticipation with pre-activated codes
- **Cost savings:** Avoid printing new codes for time-limited campaigns

**Estimated Development:** 1-2 weeks

---

### 7. CRM Integration with Lead Export (Salesforce, AmoCRM)

**Problem It Solves:**
Brands collect scan data in chestno.ru but must manually export and import to CRM systems. Sales teams don't know which leads scanned QR codes. No automated follow-up workflows.

**Solution:**
Integrate with popular CRM systems (inspired by Uniqode):
- **Direct integrations:**
  - AmoCRM (dominant in Russia)
  - Salesforce (international brands)
  - Bitrix24 (Russian alternative)
- **Auto-export:** When QR scanned, create lead in CRM with:
  - Scan timestamp, location, device type
  - Product scanned (SKU/label)
  - Custom fields (e.g., UTM parameters)
- **Zapier webhook:** For other CRMs (4000+ apps)
- **Lead scoring:** Flag high-engagement users (multiple scans, long session time)

**Implementation Complexity:** **Medium**
- OAuth integration with CRM APIs
- Mapping chestno.ru fields to CRM fields (configurable per org)
- Webhook system for Zapier
- UI to connect CRM accounts and configure field mapping
- Error handling for failed API calls

**Expected User Impact:**
- **Sales teams:** Automatic lead generation from QR scans
- **Marketing automation:** Trigger email campaigns for scanners
- **ROI tracking:** Prove QR campaign effectiveness with closed sales
- **Revenue opportunity:** Premium feature for enterprise tier

**Estimated Development:** 8-10 weeks (3-4 weeks per CRM integration)

---

### 8. Print-Ready Templates & Multi-Code PDF Generation

**Problem It Solves:**
Brands export individual QR codes as PNGs, then manually arrange in design software for printing. Time-consuming for bulk operations (e.g., 100 products). No guarantee codes print at correct size for scannability.

**Solution:**
Generate print-ready PDFs with QR codes (new feature, not in competitors' standard offerings):
- **Single-code templates:**
  - QR code + product label + URL
  - Custom branding (logo, colors)
  - Multiple size options (sticker, label, poster)
  - Print guides (cut lines, safe area markers)
- **Multi-code layouts:**
  - 6-up, 12-up, 24-up layouts (multiple codes per page)
  - Auto-layout with spacing optimization
  - Batch generate for all products in category
- **Scannability validation:**
  - Ensure minimum QR size (2cm × 2cm at 300 DPI)
  - Contrast check for printability
  - Error correction level recommendation

**Implementation Complexity:** **Medium**
- PDF generation library (e.g., ReportLab for Python or pdfmake for Node)
- Template designer (drag-drop UI for brand customization)
- Layout algorithms for multi-code pages
- Print preview with scannability warnings

**Expected User Impact:**
- **Small businesses:** No design software needed - ready-to-print files
- **Time savings:** 10-20 minutes per batch vs. manual layout
- **Print quality:** Guaranteed scannability (reduce printing errors)
- **Professional appearance:** Branded templates look polished

**Estimated Development:** 6-8 weeks

---

### 9. A/B Testing Framework for QR Campaigns

**Problem It Solves:**
Brands don't know which QR design, placement, or call-to-action performs best. Must rely on guesswork or run sequential tests (slow, unreliable). No way to compare multiple strategies simultaneously.

**Solution:**
Built-in A/B testing for QR campaigns (mentioned by Beaconstac):
- **Test creation:**
  - Create multiple QR codes (variants A, B, C) for same product
  - Assign different designs (colors, logos, CTAs)
  - Distribute variants randomly or by location
- **Performance tracking:**
  - Compare scan rates per variant
  - Track post-scan engagement (time on page, conversions)
  - Statistical significance calculator
- **Auto-winner selection:**
  - After target sample size, declare winner
  - Optionally redirect all variants to winning destination
- **Test types:**
  - Design variants (colors, shapes, logos)
  - CTA variants (different frame messages)
  - Placement variants (different product locations)

**Implementation Complexity:** **Medium**
- A/B test configuration UI (create variants, set sample size)
- Random assignment logic (ensure fair distribution)
- Statistical analysis (chi-square test for significance)
- Winner declaration and auto-redirect
- Comparison dashboard (side-by-side metrics)

**Expected User Impact:**
- **Brands:** Data-driven optimization (15-30% scan rate improvement)
- **Marketing teams:** Validate assumptions with real user behavior
- **Product managers:** Optimize packaging design based on performance
- **Competitive advantage:** Scientific approach to QR campaigns

**Estimated Development:** 6-8 weeks

---

### 10. Real-Time Scan Notifications & Alerts (Telegram/Email)

**Problem It Solves:**
Brands check analytics dashboard periodically but miss important events. Cannot respond quickly to suspicious activity (counterfeit spikes), viral campaigns, or VIP scans (high-value regions).

**Solution:**
Real-time notification system (inspired by QR Tiger + Uniqode Slack integration):
- **Notification channels:**
  - Telegram bot (popular in Russia)
  - Email alerts
  - Webhook for custom integrations
- **Alert triggers:**
  - Suspicious activity: 10+ scans of same code within 1 hour (possible counterfeit)
  - Geographic anomaly: Scans in unexpected region (distribution issue or counterfeit)
  - Milestone alerts: 100th/1000th scan of campaign
  - Low engagement: No scans in 7 days for active product
  - High engagement: Scan rate 10x above average (viral potential)
- **Custom rules:**
  - Set thresholds per product or campaign
  - Schedule quiet hours (no alerts at night)
  - Filter by notification importance (critical, info, FYI)

**Implementation Complexity:** **Low-Medium**
- Telegram Bot API integration
- Email notification system (SendGrid or similar)
- Alert rule engine (evaluate conditions on each scan)
- UI to configure notification preferences
- Rate limiting (don't spam with 100 alerts)

**Expected User Impact:**
- **Brand protection:** Rapid response to counterfeit activity
- **Campaign management:** Capitalize on viral moments in real-time
- **Customer service:** Address issues before negative reviews

- Retargeting pixels: Load asynchronously, don't block page rendering
- A/B testing: Pre-assign variants to avoid latency on scan

**Database Optimization:**
- Index on `device_type`, `scan_location` for analytics queries
- Partition `qr_events` table by month for historical data
- Use materialized views for heatmap aggregations

### Security

**Anti-Abuse Measures:**
- Rate limiting on scan endpoints (100 scans/IP/hour)
- Anomaly detection for counterfeit alerts (ML-based or rule-based)
- CRM integration: OAuth tokens stored encrypted
- Print templates: Limit generation to 100 PDFs/hour per org
